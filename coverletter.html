        <p><strong>Hiring Manager<br>
        Electronic Arts (EA SPORTS)<br>
        Orlando, FL</strong></p>

        <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

        <p>
          I am excited to apply for the Content Designer position on the College Football project at EA SPORTS. With solid programming experience in C++, C, and Java and a proven track record of creative problem‑solving, I am eager to design and implement rich, engaging game content that elevates the player experience.

        <p>
          As a Volunteer Worker at Second Harvest Food Bank, I honed my collaboration and communication skills while supporting fast‑paced distribution efforts. My tenure on the Foundation Academy Robotics team gave me hands‑on exposure to both software and hardware challenges, where I learned to think creatively under tight deadlines—apt preparation for balancing gameplay mechanics with user engagement.
        </p>
        <p>
          My lifelong passion for football gaming drives my enthusiasm for this role. I understand the nuances of game‑play balance and player psychology, and I look forward to contributing my technical expertise and team‑first mindset to the EA SPORTS College Football team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for considering my application. I welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can help deliver an immersive, dynamic football experience. Please feel free to contact me at 407‑443‑8565 or andrewstoumbos@gmail.com.
        </p>
