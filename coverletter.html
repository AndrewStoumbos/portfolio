      <h2>Cover Letter & Resume Assignment</h2>
      <p><em>Intro:</em> I refined my cover letter to clearly showcase my programming expertise in C++, C, and Java, tailored it to the EA SPORTS Content Designer role, and polished the formatting (consistent headers, right‑aligned date). <br>
        I reorganized my resume into clearly labeled sections—Education, Volunteer Experience, and Technical Skills—emphasizing my UCF scholarship, hands‑on robotics and community service work, and software proficiencies. <br>
        The combined package now reads as a cohesive, professional application highlighting both my technical strengths and teamwork experience.</p>
